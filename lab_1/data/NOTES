scr.csv: created from Chronic_Kidney_Disease, adding sex and ethnic from
         binomial distributions (p=0.5 for sex, p=0.2 for ethnic)

birthweight.txt: created from babies.data: height: converted to cm, weight
          to kgs, parity to first.born

longegfr[12].csv: created by splitting data.sim.ibm of package lmenssp,
          rounding age and follow-up time, transforming log.egfr to egfr,
          and removing egfr > 175. Changed some values so that there are
          patients with average eGFR < 15.

chdagesex.csv: inspired by chdage.dat but created as follows:
          set.seed(1)
          chdnew <- data.frame(AGE=sample(25:80, 500, TRUE),
                               SEX=rbinom(500, 1, 0.5))
          logit.chd <- -7.31 + 0.031 * chdnew$AGE + 1.78 * chdnew$SEX +
                        0.035 * (chdnew$AGE - 100) * chdnew$SEX + rnorm(500)
          prob.chd <- exp(logit.chd) / (1 + exp(logit.chd))
          chdnew$CHD <- rbinom(500, 1, prob.chd) 

drink.csv: derived from bupa.data and bupa.names

clev.csv: added names from processed.cleveland.data

hemophilia.csv: hemophilia dataset from package rrcov

esoph.csv: derived from builtin dataset esoph

zprostate.csv: derived from zprostate from package bestglm

support.csv: derived from support.sav (http://biostat.mc.vanderbilt.edu/wiki/Main/DataSets)

nki.csv: derived from nki70 from package penalized

wdbc.csv: derived from wdbc.data and wdbc.names
wdbc2.csv: derived from wdbc by removing the .worst variables and swapping some diagnosis labels

birthwt.csv: derived from birthwt from package MASS

hepcidin.csv: derived from http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.br52k

GDM.raw.txt, GDM.test.txt: derived from http://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.kq0k2

urate-gwas.txt, ldpred.txt: from the ~/projects/ldpred

dpt.txt: derived from /opt/shared/genome/scores/sourcedata/ega_public/dupuytren_egad115
dpt2.txt: derived from dpt, with odds-ratio column replaced with log odds-ratio (beta)

batch1.csv, batch2.csv: created

lipids.txt: derived from lipidomics.txt with rows reshuffled and some lipid
 names changed, and the addition of a column of standard errors computed
 using the formula:
     z.score = qnorm(1 - p.value / 2) = beta / SE
     SE = beta / z.score
     se <- with(lipids, abs(log(oddsratio)) / (qnorm(1 - p.value / 2)))
 p-values can be recomputed using the following formula
     pnew <- with(lipids, pnorm(abs(log(oddsratio)) / se, lower.tail=FALSE) * 2
